NuclearFuelRodTemperatureProfile

This repository contains a Python program that calculates and visualizes the temperature distribution within a nuclear fuel rod. The program models the temperature profile across different sections of the fuel rod, including the fuel, gap, and clad regions. The calculations are based on specified parameters such as fuel rod dimensions, material properties, and volumetric heat generation.

Features:

    Three-zone temperature modeling (Fuel, Gap, Clad).
    Heat generation input for accurate simulation.
    Visualization of the temperature profile.

Usage:

    Adjust parameters such as fuel rod dimensions, material properties, and heat generation in the code.
    Run the Python script to calculate and plot the temperature distribution.

Note:
This program serves as a simple yet informative tool for understanding the thermal behavior of nuclear fuel rods. It can be used for educational purposes or as a starting point for more complex simulations.
